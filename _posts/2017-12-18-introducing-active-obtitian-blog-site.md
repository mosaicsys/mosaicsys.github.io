title: Introducing the Active Obtitian blog site
---

This site is the unofficial blogging site for the Active Obtitian.  
It is a slowly growing set of thoughts and ruminations about all things related to the active object pattern and especially about the use of the [MosaicLibCS](https://github.com/mosaicsys/mosaiclibcs) project.

## Purpose

It generally focuses on the use of such patterns in the semiconductor capital equipment business but many aspects of it may be useful in other similar industries.

## Site

This site uses a theme based on [lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
